# Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on the detection and classification of plant leaf diseases using advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. The primary goal is to identify and categorize diseases affecting plant leaves, enabling early intervention to improve agricultural productivity and minimize losses. The project incorporates state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, including CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) and compound scaling, to enhance model performance.



**Features:**
- Disease detection and classification using images of plant leaves.
- Implementation of various CNN architectures:
    - AlexNet
